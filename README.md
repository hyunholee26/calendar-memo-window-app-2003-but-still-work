# calendar-memo-window-app-2003-but-still-work

When I was undergradute, I made calendar & memo application using Windows API and VC6.
Since I called CreateWindow() many times, I still remember 10 arguments of CreateWindow() :)

NOW, I do not have source code, just have execution files. However, I checked that it still work, I share it.
